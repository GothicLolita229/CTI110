   COL TRAUTMAN
The mission is over, understood?
The mission is over!
Look at them outside.
Look at them!
End it, or they'll kill you.
Do you want that?
lt's over, Johnny. lt's over!

Nothing is over! Nothing! You can't just switch it off! lt wasn't my war. You asked me, l didn't ask you!  l did everything to win, but someone didn't let us win!
